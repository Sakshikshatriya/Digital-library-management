# Digital-library-management
Library Management System Project is developed in Java, to provide all the features that a Library Management System should usually have and overcome the drawbacks of the present system such as:

1) Paper-based record keeping.
2) Mis-management of data due to manual and paper-based handling.
3) A vast amount of time consumption in searching for books and library management.
4) Book-thefts from the library
